# Day 12: Christmas Tree Farm

Although the generic problem description is hard (box packing problem) and
could be unsolvable, the input data is actually quite weak.

We can just eyeball the answer by estimating the "fullness" of the box packing
configuration, and just say that fullness greater than ~80% is probably
unsolvable.

Use this pipeline to:
1.  Calculate a fullness metric for each input
2.  Sort by fullness score
3.  Calculate the delta of fullness core between each input
4.  Sort by the delta
5.  Find the position with the largest delta. That indicates where the box
    configurations change from unsolvable to solvable.

```sh
grep 'x' input/d12.txt | awk -F'[ :x]' '{ total_area=$1*$2; min_area=7 * ($3 + $4 + $5 + $6 + $7 + $8); fullness=min_area / total_area; print fullness, $0 }' | sort -n | awk '{delta=$1 - prev; prev=$1; print exp(delta * log(10)), delta, $0}' | nl | sort -n -k2 -r | less
```
